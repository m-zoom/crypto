We are going to build a Flask web application for the Automated Forex Chart Pattern Recognition System. The application will have the following features:
1. User Interface (HTML/CSS/JS):
   - A dropdown to select the stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, EURUSD, etc.)
   - A dropdown to select the timeframe (e.g., 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min, daily)
   - Buttons to start and stop real-time monitoring.
   - A section to display the current chart (using a JavaScript charting library like Chart.js or Plotly.js) for the selected stock and timeframe. This chart will update during real-time monitoring.
   - A section to display the detected patterns (with confidence) and logs (split into: patterns detected, patterns not detected, and model prediction details).
2. Backend (Flask):
   - Endpoints to serve the main page, handle the real-time monitoring, and fetch data.
   - We will integrate the existing scripts (`getfulldata.py` for initial full data and plotting, `getdata.py` for real-time 5min data, and `pattern_detector.py` for pattern detection) into the Flask app.
3. Real-time Monitoring:
   - When the user starts monitoring, the backend will start a background thread that periodically (based on the selected timeframe) fetches the latest data, runs the pattern detection, and sends updates to the frontend via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE). However, for simplicity, we can use a polling mechanism from the frontend to get updates.
4. Pattern Detection:
   - We will use the models (double_bottom_model.pkl, double_top_model.pkl, triple_bottom_model.pkl, triple_top_model.pkl) to detect patterns on the latest data.
5. Logging:
   - The logs will be displayed in the UI in separate sections (or with different colors) for detected, not detected, and other information.
Given the complexity, we'll break down the implementation into steps:
### Step 1: Set up the Flask application structure
```
project/
│
├── app.py                  # Main Flask application
├── templates/
│   └── index.html          # Main HTML template
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── style.css       # Custom CSS
│   └── js/
│       └── script.js       # Custom JavaScript for interactions
├── models/                 # Directory for the pattern detection models
│   ├── double_bottom_model.pkl
│   ├── double_top_model.pkl
│   ├── triple_bottom_model.pkl
│   └── triple_top_model.pkl
├── utils/
│   ├── data_fetcher.py     # Contains functions from getdata.py and getfulldata.py
│   └── pattern_detector.py # Adapted from pattern_detector.py for use in the app
└── .env                    # For API key
```
### Step 2: Adapt the existing scripts for use in Flask
We will create a module `utils` that contains:
- `data_fetcher.py`: Combines the functionality of `getfulldata.py` and `getdata.py` to fetch data for a given ticker and timeframe.
- `pattern_detector.py`: Adapted from the provided `pattern_detector.py` to be used as a library. We will remove the main function and make it callable from the Flask app.
We need to modify the `pattern_detector.py` to:
- Not run as a standalone script when imported.
- Provide a function to run a detection cycle and return the results and logs.
### Step 3: Implement WebSockets or SSE for real-time updates (optional)
For simplicity, we can use a polling mechanism from the frontend. The frontend will periodically (every 5 seconds) request the latest results from the backend.
Alternatively, we can use Flask-SocketIO for real-time bidirectional communication.
Given the time, we'll use polling for the first version.
### Step 4: Build the frontend with Chart.js
We'll use Chart.js to plot the candlestick chart. We need to convert the DataFrame to a format that Chart.js can use.
### Step 5: Implement the real-time monitoring in the background
When the user starts monitoring, we will start a background thread that runs the detection at the specified frequency. The results of each cycle will be stored in a global variable (or a cache like Redis) and the frontend will poll for updates.
However, note that having a long-running background thread in Flask might not be the best practice (due to the possibility of multiple workers and scaling issues). For a production system, we would use a task queue (like Celery). But for simplicity and the scope of this project, we'll use a background thread and store the state in a global variable (with thread locks).
### Step 6: Display logs in the UI
We will capture the logs (from the pattern detection cycles) and store them in a list. The frontend will fetch the latest logs and display them in separate sections (or with different styles) based on the log content.
Given the complexity, let's outline the code structure:
#### `app.py`
```python
import os
import threading
import time
from datetime import datetime
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify, request
# Import our utils
from utils.data_fetcher import get_full_data, get_recent_data
from utils.pattern_detector import setup_pattern_detector, run_detection_cycle
app = Flask(__name__)
# Global state (for simplicity, not production-safe without proper locking)
monitoring_state = {
    'is_monitoring': False,
    'ticker': None,
    'timeframe': None,
    'logs': [],
    'last_detection_results': None,
    'chart_data': None
}
# Lock for thread safety
monitor_lock = threading.Lock()
def monitoring_loop():
    while True:
        with monitor_lock:
            if not monitoring_state['is_monitoring']:
                break
            # Run detection cycle
            ticker = monitoring_state['ticker']
            timeframe = monitoring_state['timeframe']
            # Fetch recent data for the given ticker and timeframe (LOOKBACK_CANDLES)
            candles = get_recent_data(ticker, LOOKBACK_CANDLES, timeframe)
            if candles is None:
                # Log error
                monitoring_state['logs'].append(f"{datetime.now()} - ERROR: Failed to fetch data")
                continue
            # Run pattern detection
            results, logs = run_detection_cycle(candles)  # This function should return results and logs
            # Update state
            monitoring_state['last_detection_results'] = results
            monitoring_state['logs'].extend(logs)
            # Also update chart data? Or we have a separate endpoint for chart data?
            # For the chart, we can store the last 20 candles? Or we can fetch the chart data separately?
            # We'll store the candles for the chart
            monitoring_state['chart_data'] = candles
        # Sleep for the monitoring frequency (convert to seconds)
        time.sleep(monitoring_frequency_in_seconds(timeframe))
def monitoring_frequency_in_seconds(timeframe):
    # Convert timeframe to seconds
    if timeframe == '5min':
        return 5 * 60
    elif timeframe == '15min':
        return 15 * 60
    # ... etc.
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')
@app.route('/start_monitoring', methods=['POST'])
def start_monitoring():
    global monitoring_state
    data = request.json
    ticker = data['ticker']
    timeframe = data['timeframe']
    with monitor_lock:
        if monitoring_state['is_monitoring']:
            return jsonify({'status': 'already running'})
        monitoring_state['is_monitoring'] = True
        monitoring_state['ticker'] = ticker
        monitoring_state['timeframe'] = timeframe
        monitoring_state['logs'] = []
        monitoring_state['last_detection_results'] = None
        monitoring_state['chart_data'] = None
    # Start the monitoring thread
    thread = threading.Thread(target=monitoring_loop)
    thread.daemon = True
    thread.start()
    return jsonify({'status': 'started'})
@app.route('/stop_monitoring', methods=['POST'])
def stop_monitoring():
    with monitor_lock:
        monitoring_state['is_monitoring'] = False
    return jsonify({'status': 'stopped'})
@app.route('/get_monitoring_data')
def get_monitoring_data():
    with monitor_lock:
        # Return the current state: logs, chart_data, results
        return jsonify({
            'is_monitoring': monitoring_state['is_monitoring'],
            'logs': monitoring_state['logs'],
            'results': monitoring_state['last_detection_results'],
            'chart_data': monitoring_state['chart_data']  # Format this appropriately for Chart.js
        })
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Load models once at startup
    setup_pattern_detector()  # This function loads the models and sets up the logger
    app.run(debug=True)
```
#### `utils/pattern_detector.py`
We need to adapt the provided `pattern_detector.py` to be a library. We'll remove the main function and provide:
- `setup_pattern_detector()`: to load the models and set up logging (but we might capture logs in a list instead of file).
- `run_detection_cycle(candles)`: runs the detection on the provided candles and returns the results and logs.
We can capture the logs by using a logger that writes to a string buffer.
#### `utils/data_fetcher.py`
This will contain functions to fetch data:
```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pytz
# ... (code from getfulldata.py and getdata.py adapted as functions)
def get_full_data(ticker, start_date, end_date, timeframe):
    # ... implementation using the code from getfulldata.py but generalized for timeframe
    pass
def get_recent_data(ticker, num_candles, timeframe):
    # ... implementation using the code from pattern_detector.py's get_recent_data function
    pass
```
### Frontend (index.html)
We'll use Chart.js for the candlestick chart and jQuery for simplicity.
The frontend will:
- Have dropdowns for ticker and timeframe.
- Buttons to start and stop monitoring.
- A canvas for the chart.
- A section for logs (with subsections for detected, not detected, and others).
We'll use polling (setInterval) to fetch the latest monitoring data from `/get_monitoring_data` and update the logs and chart.
Given the complexity of the candlestick chart, we can use a Chart.js candlestick chart example.
### Note
This is a high-level design. The actual implementation will require careful handling of the data formats and error conditions.
Due to the complexity and time constraints, we might need to simplify some parts. For example, the real-time chart update might only show the last 20 candles (or the lookback period) and update with the latest data.
We'll also need to format the logs to separate "Detected", "Not Detected", and "Info" messages.
This design should be detailed enough to guide the implementation.
